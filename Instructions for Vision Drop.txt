# VisionDrop - Image Recognition Application
# Installation and Usage Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or newer
- Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended for managing dependencies)

## Installation Steps

1. Install Anaconda (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

2. Create a new conda environment
   Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) and run:
   conda create -n visiondrop python=3.8 -y

3. Activate the environment
   conda activate visiondrop

4. Install required packages
   conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow pillow numpy -y 
   pip install pyttsx3 
   pip install tkinterdnd2

5. Save the VisionDrop application code
- Create a folder for the application (e.g., "VisionDrop")
- Save the provided Python code as "visiondrop.py" in this folder

## Running the Application

1. Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux)

2. Activate the conda environment:
   conda activate visiondrop

3. Navigate to the folder containing visiondrop.py:
   cd path/to/VisionDrop
   Replace "path/to/VisionDrop" with the actual path to your folder
   example: C:\Users\jaede\Downloads\VisionDrop-Package

4. Run the application
   python VisionDrop.py



## Using the Application

1. The application window will open with a drop area labeled "Drop Image Here"

2. You can either:
- Drag and drop an image file onto the drop area
- Click on the drop area to open a file browser and select an image

3. The application will process the image and display recognition results

4. Features:
- "Speak Results" button: Have the computer read out the top predictions
- "Clear" button: Clear the current image and results
- "Model" dropdown: Switch between different neural network models
  - MobileNetV2 (fastest)
  - ResNet50 (more accurate)
  - InceptionV3 (most accurate but slower)

5. Scroll down to see all results if they don't fit in the window

## Troubleshooting

1. If you see an error about missing packages:
- Make sure you've activated the correct conda environment
- Try reinstalling the required packages

2. If the application window appears blank:
- Try resizing the window
- Check the console for error messages

3. If text-to-speech doesn't work:
- On Windows: No additional setup needed
- On macOS: You may need to install espeak (`brew install espeak`)
- On Linux: Install espeak (`sudo apt-get install espeak`)

4. If the application is slow when processing images:
- Try using the MobileNetV2 model (fastest)
- Close other applications to free up memory

## Creating a Shortcut (Optional)

### Windows:
1. Create a batch file (run_visiondrop.bat) with the following content:
   @echo off call conda activate visiondrop python path\to\VisionDrop\visiondrop.py pause

2. Replace "path\to\VisionDrop" with the actual path
3. Save this file to your desktop for easy access

### macOS/Linux:
1. Create a shell script (run_visiondrop.sh) with the following content:
   #!/bin/bash source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh conda activate visiondrop python /path/to/VisionDrop/visiondrop.py
2. Replace "/path/to/VisionDrop" with the actual path
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x run_visiondrop.sh`


## Additional Information

### Supported Image Formats
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)
- GIF (.gif)

### How the Recognition Works
VisionDrop uses pre-trained deep learning models to recognize objects in images:
- MobileNetV2: A lightweight model designed for mobile and edge devices
- ResNet50: A deeper model with better accuracy but requires more processing power
- InceptionV3: A sophisticated model with high accuracy but slower processing

The models are trained to recognize 1000 different object categories from the ImageNet dataset.

### Understanding the Results
- Each prediction shows a label and a confidence percentage
- Higher percentages indicate greater confidence in the prediction
- The application shows the top 5 predictions for each image

### Debug Information
The debug information at the bottom of the window shows:
- The image filename
- Original image dimensions
- Input array shape for the neural network
- Model input shape requirements

### Memory Usage
Deep learning models can use significant memory. If you experience performance issues:
- Try closing other applications
- Use the MobileNetV2 model which requires less memory
- Restart the application if it becomes slow after processing multiple images

### Offline Usage
Once installed, VisionDrop works completely offline. No internet connection is required for image recognition.

## Updating the Application

If you receive an updated version of the code:
1. Replace the existing visiondrop.py file with the new version
2. No additional installation steps are needed unless new dependencies are added

## Uninstalling

To remove VisionDrop:
1. Delete the folder containing visiondrop.py
2. Optionally remove the conda environment:
   conda deactivate conda remove -n visiondrop --all

## Technical Support

If you encounter issues not covered in the troubleshooting section:
1. Check that all prerequisites are installed correctly
2. Verify that you're using a supported Python version (3.7 or newer)
3. Make sure TensorFlow is properly installed in your environment
4. Check for error messages in the console/terminal window

## Credits

VisionDrop uses the following open-source technologies:
- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning models
- Tkinter for the graphical user interface
- PIL/Pillow for image processing
- pyttsx3 for text-to-speech capabilities
- tkinterdnd2 for drag-and-drop functionality

The pre-trained models (MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3) were developed by various research teams and are provided through the TensorFlow/Keras applications module.
